## reflection (7)

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

> Saves your work some where "save" and allows you to share your work


## reflection (10)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

> Allows you to keep track of your changes vs thinks changes "all the time" 

## reflection (14)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

> branches is on the same "code base" and allows you easily to work on new features, bug fixes without breaking the "main" code
> clones are full copies, but after the copy no shared history...
> forks are full copies and linked to each other so code of one can be "send" to the other...

## reflection (22)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

> Much easier to check out the difference and then do the merge as a seperate action vs pull all on once action

## reflection (25)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

> Using share or email, but than required to communicate who does what and where. So this will be harder keeping versions in sync even with a central location useing a remote file store.. forget about change history...
